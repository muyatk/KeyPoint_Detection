# KeyPoint_Detection
PyTorch-Keras KeyPoint Detection of different objects

### PyTorch Conversion

- In this project we made a conversion for the Keras coding example that has been introduced in here : [link](https://keras.io/examples/vision/keypoint_detection/)

- Both notebooks have been trained in local computer with RTX 4070 GPU.

* This repo includes a good example for showing small differences between two frameworks.

* Related images can be obtained via [link](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/images.tar)

* This KeyPoint Detection example serves as a strong end-to-end reference implementation. It can be further enhanced by experimenting with different model architectures or by improving the data augmentation strategy.
